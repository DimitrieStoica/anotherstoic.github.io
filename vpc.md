## Virtual Private Cloud - VPC ##

- first logical foundation that allows you to create/deploy/configure services & instances
- logically isolated network in the AWS cloud - private CIDR block of AWS cloud
- a VPC is region-wide -> use all available AZs
- the size of a VPC cannot be changed
- consists of: subnets, route tables, internet gateways, elastic IPs, endpoints, NAT gateways, peering connections, network ACLs, security groups, VPN

> Default VPC: logically isolated network with a default subnet, security group and an Internet Gateway -> any instance will automatically receive public IP address

### Pricing ###
- there are no charges for creating and using a VPC <-> accessing AWS resources via your VPC internet gateway is free
- VPN connections and data transfer are charged (pair per hour basis)
- no charge for creating a VPC peering connection <->  data transfer across the peering connection is charged
- no charge for using classic link <-> data transfer across availability zones is charged

## VPC Core Components ##
### Subnets ###
- are CIDR blocks within the IP range of your VPC, there can be one or more subnets in a VPC
- 5 IPs reserved/subnet (first 4 and last 1). For example, in a subnet with CIDR block 172.0.0.0/24, the following five IP addresses are reserved:
  * 172.0.0.0: Network address
  * 172.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
  * 172.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for the DNS server
  * 172.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use
  * 172.0.0.255: Network broadcast address
- Subnets:
  * private: DBs, Application Servers, File Servers
  * public: Web Servers, NAT, VPN
  * VPN dedicated
- Subnets do not span across AZs
- netmask between CIDR 16-28
- each subnet must be associated with a Route table and a Network Access Control List

### Internet Gateway - IGW ###
- provides connectivity in and out of the VPC
- provides a target in the VPC route table for Internet-routable traffic
- performs network address translation for instances that have been assigned public IP addresses
- if a subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway = `public subnet`

> `default route table` = initially only a single route: a local route that enables communication within the VPC.

> for internate routable subnets Internet Gateways provide a route in the table 0.0.0.0/0

### Direct Connect ###
- private dedicated connection between VPC and on prem

## VPC Security ##

`Security zoning` is creating a group of system components which have similar security levels and a group of common controls

| Security Groups | Network Access Control Lists |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| operates at the instance level | operates at the subnet level |
| supports only ALLOW rules | supports ALLOW and DENY rules |
| applies to an instance only if associated with an sg | automatically applies to an instance |
| STATEFUL: return traffic allowed is assumed | STATELESS: traffic is strictly filtered, return traffic allowed is not assumed |

> for inbound traffic: Network ACL's are evaluated first followed by security groups rules
> for outbound traffic: Security groups are evaluated first followed by Network ACL's

`Security groups`: deny all incoming traffic by default and use allow rules that can filter based on port and protocol
`Network ACL`: allow all inbloud/outbound traffic by default

## VPC NAT Gateways ##
- allows private instances to get access to the Internet
- scale UP: choose an instance that supports enhanced networking
- scale OUT: add NATs per subnets and distribute workload (1 Subnet = 1 NAT)
- HA by failing over to another NAT

> a NAT gateway in the pending, active, or deleting state counts against your limit

## Endpoints ##
- when trying to access services like S3 communication happens over the internet
- to keep the traffic localized (security/regulatory/performance) you can deploy an endpoint and route traffic from subnet to a service

## VPC Peering ##
- network connection between 2 or more VPC's in the same region - same AWS account or different AWS account
- uses private IP addresses
- enables the routing using each other VPC's private IP address -> no overlapping IP address ranges
- there is no single point of failure or network bandwidth bottleneck between the VPCs

> expiry time for an unaccepted VPC peering connection request is 1 week (168 hours)

## VPN Connectivity ##
- a VPN connection refers to the connection between your VPC and your own network

> Virtual Private Gateway: the anchor on the AWS side of the VPN connection

> if a VPN connection have been compromised, you can change the IKE preshared key

> VPN connection-hours are billed for any time your VPN connections are in the "available" state

### Corporate or home network to Amazon VPC ###
- extend network to AWS -> use AWS services seamlessly
- no overlapping IP ranges

+ Hardware based IpSec VPN over the Internet
+ Direct Connect with VPN: 1 or 10 10 gigabit link
+ Software based VPN over the Internet: fully customer managed -> need to manage HA
+ VPN Cloud Hub: hub and spoke mode between a hardware VPN and direct connect option (Amazon VPC, virtual private gateway, with multiple customer gateways) that allows multiple VPN

### Amazon VPC to Amazon VPC ###
+ VPC peering
+ software-based VPNs. In this configuration, you need to have an internet gateway at both VPCs to enable communication between the software-based VPN appliances, fully customer managed -> need to manage HA
+ hardware based IPSEC VPN connection between VPC's
+ VPC to VPC over direct connect

### End user to VPC ###
+ corporate home network to the VPC
+ software remote access VPN

## VPC Scenarios ##
- VPC with single public subnet
- VPC with public and private subnet
- VPC with public and private subnets and a hardware of VPN access
- VPC with private subnet only and hardware VPN access

> the hotplug script that is part of ec2-net-utils used with ENIs generates an interface configuration file suitable for use with DHCP

> a set of DHCP options can't be modified -> create a new set of DHCP and associate them with your VPC

## Elastic network interface (ENI) ##
- a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a VPC
- it can include: one public IP address, a MAC address,  source/destination check flag, a description, a primary private IP address, one or more secondary private IP addresses, one Elastic IP address per private IP address

> network interfaces that are automatically created and attached to instances terminate when the instance terminates. However, network interfaces created using the command line interface aren't set to terminate when the instance terminates.

## Limitations ##
- the default limit of route tables allowed per VPC is 200
- default limit for NAT gateways per Availability Zone is 5
- default number of VPC Peering connections is 50
- the maximum number of security groups per network interface an instance in a VPC can belong to is 5.

## VPC Flow Logs ##
- is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC
- it will capture accepted and rejected traffic flow information for all network interfaces in the selected resource
