# Object Oriented Programming
- pattern/paradigm of programming where the solution to a programming problem is modelled as a collection of collaborating objects

## Class
- a representation of a type of object
- blueprint that describes the details of an object - both state (attributes) and behaviour (methods)

## Object
- an instance of a class
- it has its own state, behavior, and identity
- an entity that possesses both state (attributes) and behaviour (methods)

## Basic concepts of OOP

1. Encapsulation
- describes the idea of grouping data and methods as a single unit
- the variables of a class are restricted from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class

> data hiding: technique to hide internal object details from unauthorized access

2. Abstraction
- a method of expressing the important properties without involving the background details
- it concentrates on the external aspect of an object

3. Inheritance
- the process where one class acquires the properties (attributes and methods) of another
- subclass (child class) inherits properties from a superclass (parent class) = common properties

4. Polymorphism
- the ability of an object to take on many forms

> overriding: means to override the functionality of an existing method

## Overloading
- is static binding
- is the same method with different arguments, that may or may not return the same value

## Overriding
- is dynamic binding
- is the same method names with same arguments and return types associated with the class and its child class

## Constructor
- a constructor is a method used to initialize the state of an object
- it gets invoked at the time of object creation

## Modular Programming
- the process of subdividing a program into separate sub-programs
- modules enforce logical boundaries between components
- advantages: reusability, simplicity, ease of maintenance
