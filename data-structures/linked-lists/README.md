# The Node

The Node is the most basic block for many common Data Structures.

It provides 2 functions:
* it provides a mechanism to contain a piece of data
* it provides a mean of connecting itself to other nodes via a reference pointer

# Linked Lists

A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links:
* single chain of nodes
* head pointer
* tail pointer

Operations:
* add
* remove
* find
* enumerate

Characteristics:
* efficient insertion
* works well for forward access

# Double Linked Lists

A special type of linked list where each node contains a pointer to the next and previous node
