# Elastic Load Balancer - ELB #

- directs and routes traffic across a fleet of EC2's to `maintain HA and Resiliency`
- distributes requests across all servers and across multiple AZ's (recommended to use at least 2) - region wide load balancers
- `internal LB` - internal IP address, accessed only from the internal network 
- `external LB` - public IP address
- ELB does not terminate or start instances, but it detects the health of an instance

> it monitors the health of any instance associated to any ELB by performing a ping. If a response in not received after TTL expired the instance will be noted as unhealthy and traffic will not be routed to that instance

- supports sticky sessions using cookies - traffic is routed to the same instances as the user continues to access an application
- enables SSL offloading and supports SSL termination

## ELB types ##

### Classic Load Balancing ###
- Layer 4 and Layer 7 LB - SSL termination and processing (results in better performance for EC2's)
- cookie-based sticky sessions
- it can be integrated with Cloud Watch to build advanced metric load balancing (CPU, memory) and not just Round Robin 
- it can be integrated with Route 53 for DNS load balancing (multiple ELB's across multiple regions)
- supported ports: `25 (SMTP), 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS), 1024-65535`
- supports IPv4 and IPv6
- only `1 SSL certificate/ELB`, but wildcard certificates are supported
- does not support EIP - it only works with DNS
- supports domain Zone Apex (no need to use www. )
- integrates with Cloud Trail for log security analysis
- check for connection requests over HTTP, HTTPS, TCP & SSL
  
    > Cross-Zone Load Balancing: when enabled the LB probes the instances that are within the AZ and will load balance traffic against this instances. If unchecked it treats the AZ as a single instance disregarding instances within
    
    > Connection Draining timeout: when an instance is taken out of rotation, it can be immediately disconnected or slowly drained the connections out
  
### Application Load Balancing ###
- protocol oriented LB - operates at the request level = Layer 7 only
- supports path-based routing and host-based routing
- supports microservices and containers (it can dynamically map container ports)
- better performance for streaming
- reduced cost
- deletion protection - instance can't be deleted until deletion protection is deleted
- better Health Checks and Cloud Watch metrics
- check for connection requests over HTTP, HTTPS
- supports `sockets, path based routing & HTTPv2` 
  
 ### Network Load Balancer ###
 - simple LB designed to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns - TCP traffic
 - no need to be pre-warmed
 - operates at Layer 4
 - single static IP address per AZ
 - targets: EC2 instances, ECS, IP address
 - supports static and elastic IP addresses
 - can load balances across multiple ports on an instance
 
 ### What ELB type to use ###
 - support static or elastic IP address: Network LB
 - control over SSL cipher: Classic LB
 - container services or ECS: Application LB or Network LB
 - support SSL offloading: Application LB or Classic LB
 
- Listeners: 
  - define the port and the protocol
  - each ALB needs 1 Listener and up to 10 Listeners
  - routing rules are defined on listeners
  
- Target Groups:
  - logical grouping of targets for the LB
  - accepts EC2, containers - it can't be mixed and match in the same target group
  - can exist independently from the LB
  - region based but can be associated auto scaling group
  - up to 100 instances
  
- Rules: 
  - each Listener can have 1 or more rules for routing requests to a target group
  - consists of _conditions_ & _actions_: when a request meets the condition, an action is taken
  - if a request comes in that doesn't meet any of the conditions, it will use the default rule and sends it to the default target group
  
- Health Checks:
  - ALB's allow custom response codes (200-399)
  - ALB's provide detailed health check failures
  - detailed access log information delivered to an S3 bucket indexed by date
